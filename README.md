## structure
- Data: Refers to the information that the app needs to display or manipulate. This can include user data, such as account information and preferences, or content data, such as images and text.

- Models: In Flutter, models refer to classes that define the data structures for the app. Models help organize the data and provide a way to access and manipulate it.

- Provider: Provider is a state management library in Flutter that allows for sharing data between widgets efficiently. It provides a way to manage application state in a predictable way and minimizes boilerplate code.

- Screens: Screens refer to the various pages or views that make up the user interface of the app. Each screen can contain various widgets that display information and allow user interaction.

- Widget: Widgets are the basic building blocks of a Flutter app. They define the UI elements that are visible to the user, such as buttons, text fields, and images. Widgets can be combined to create more complex UI elements, such as lists and forms.
